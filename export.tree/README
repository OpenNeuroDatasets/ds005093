This dataset was gathered between 2017 and 2018 as part of "Evaluation of microglia activation related markers following a clinical course of TBS: a non-human primate study". 
This dataset consists of 11 healthy nonhuman primates and their imaging data, including PET (PBR28) and MRS. MRS data was acquired from two different voxels placed over the left and right putamen. 

PET images were acquired on a Siemens High-Resolution Research Tomograph (ECAT HRRT, CPS Innovations, Knoxville, TN, USA) with a 3-dimensional resolution of 2.5 mm.

MRS data was acquired on a Philips Achieva 3.0 T whole-body MRI scanner (Philips Healthcare, Best, The Netherlands), with an eight-channel sensitivity encoding head coil. We acquired spectra from two voxels placed over the left and right putamen. 

Note that for some of the stimulation cycles, only PET or MRS data was acquired.
This data set also includes an excel file with postmortem IHC-TSPO data.
